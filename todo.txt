TODO:

 * add "events" space to basement
   - delete two of the 6m x 3m rooms
   - one 6m x 3 room will be storage
   - one 6m x 3 room will be recording studio
   - get rid of the other 2 rooms (keep the two that are under the 1st floor bedroom)
   - this will provide a space for events with loud music that's underground, so it will muffle the noise

 * increase storey height
   - Noise isolation between floors can only achieve so much through thick concrete slabs. Specifically STS (airborne sound) can be dampened between floors with a thick slab, but IIC (impact sound) needs physical isolation. This means building a floor above the floor (eg a raised bamboo floor whoose posts sit on rubber (sound-isolation) footings on-top of the concrete floor slab.
    * See https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/60671/how-to-build-apartment-floors-ceilings-to-not-transfer-sound/60672
   - We need to figure-out the thickness of the concrete slab + the (bamboo?) floating floor above it + a buffer on the ceiling for piping, duct work, light fixtures, or a (sound isolation) drop-ceiling
    * See https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/60825/are-mutli-story-structure-slabs-poured-on-center
   - The minimum height of clearance from the top of the floating floor to the bottom of any ceiling infrastructure should be 2.4 meters. Currently the wall height of each storey is only 2.4 meters -- which doesn't even take into account the slab thickness. So we may end-up with 3-meter wall-height.

 * add stairwells on either side
    - I think I should make these entirely outside the existing structure, located on either end of the short sides of the structure. This will save space inside, be a safer fire exit, allow us to add an elevator on the outside along the stairwell, and it would allow us to re-use the same stairwell for the other buildings that would come perpendicular to this one
    - also, I think we should only have the stairwells go up to the 6th floor. We can have just a ladder and hatch to get from the 6th floor to the rooftop. This will reduce materials and prevent casting shade on our solar equipment on the rooftop

 * finish roof
    - make the steel-reinforced-concrete rooftop have a slight slope
    - add gutters
    - add transparent roofing around the perimeter
    - convert solid roof to grid of steel-reinforced concrete walkways
    - add parabolic dishes where the grid is
    - add transparent roofing where the gird is not

 * add different sizes

	Pico (6-person) (the smallest Eco-Libre Launch-Nest): it's just the basement and 1st floor, with ability to add another floor later

	Nano (14-person): Adds the second floor with two additional bedrooms

	Micro (30-person): Adds the rest of the structure

	Milli (150-person): Adds two more launch nests on either side, plus another two running parallel 60 meters away
