TODO:

 * add "events" space to basement
   - shrink two of the 6m x 3m rooms in the basement to be 3m x 3m
   - get rid of the other 2 rooms (keep the two that are under the 1st floor bedroom)
   - this will provide a space for events with loud music that's underground, so it will muffle the noise

 * move the recording studio to the basement
   - It's probably not a good idea to have the library and recording studio on the same floor
   - I was thinking the recording studio would be a quiet place (mostly for voice recording), but it would be good if it were capable for music recording too, and the basement would be a better place for that.

 * add stairwells on either side
    - I think I should make these entirely outside the existing structure, located on either end of the short sides of the structure. This will save space inside, be a safer fire exit, allow us to add an elevator on the outside along the stairwell, and it would allow us to re-use the same stairwell for the other buildings that would come perpendicular to this one
    - also, I think we should only have the stairwells go up to the 6th floor. We can have just a ladder and hatch to get from the 6th floor to the rooftop. This will reduce materials and prevent casting shade on our solar equipment on the rooftop

 * finish roof
    - make the steel-reinforced-concrete rooftop have a slight slope
    - add gutters
    - add transparent roofing around the perimeter
    - convert solid roof to grid of steel-reinforced concrete walkways
    - add parabolic dishes where the grid is
    - add transparent roofing where the gird is not

 * add different sizes

	Pico (6-person) (the smallest Eco-Libre Launch-Nest): it's just the basement and 1st floor, with ability to add another floor later

	Nano (14-person): Adds the second floor with two additional bedrooms

	Micro (30-person): Adds the rest of the structure

	Milli (150-person): Adds two more launch nests on either side, plus another two running parallel 60 meters away

 * add room dividers
	 - first floor reqs: showers for 30 people, kitchen for 30 people
		I don't think I can continue until I figure out how much space I'd need for ~6 showers + ~6 sinks, and a kitchen that'll feed 30 people. That will determine the length of the building.

 * add floors
